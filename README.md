## :innocent: Motivation
It is estimated that nearly 285 million people in the world are visually impaired and the idea is to facilitate a suitable communication system for them. This reason was the driving force behind developing the given system. One of the major disadvantages of the existing system is that all operations are based on mouse click events. Operations depend completely on types of clicks specified by idea. Also sometimes remembering keyboard shortcuts is difficult. The extent of the existing system is limited for visually impaired people. There is a high need of developing a proper system which curbs all the above drawbacks and turn into a simple system. The idea focuses on providing basic functionalities like compose, send, receive e-mail and delete mails which goes to the trash.

## :bulb: Working

The program will function in the following way:
1. When the application is launched, the user can log in.
2. The user is prompted to enter their username and password on the login screen.
3. After a successful login, the menu page opens, prompting the user for input instructions
such as Inbox, Sent, Compose, Trash, and Logout. The user must say one of the orders,
after which he will be led depending on the voice commands.
4. On clicking Compose, the user will be sent to the Compose Page, where they will be
asked to enter the recipient's ID, topic, and email message. The email is successfully
delivered to the recipient's ID.
5. The user will be led to the received mails page after tapping on the screen, and will be
asked if they want to view the first, second, or third message.
